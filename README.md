# ng2AuthRouterStarter

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.17.
However, routes generation is disabled in [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), for the time being, making it necessary to setup routing manually for each new project. This repo aims to solve that problem by serving as a base for new angular 2 projects.
ng2AuthRouterStarter's router configuration follows official Angular2 Router [tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html) (version 2.0).

Another essential part for the most SPAs, authentication, is done via integration with [angular2-token](https://github.com/neroniaky/angular2-token) complete with [ng2ars-api](https://github.com/piotrkaczmarek/ng2ars-api) rails backend.

## Usage

ng2AuthRouterStarter is under development and it is still meant mostly for my personal use but feel free to copy repo (and contribute!) for your own projects.

You can easily rename a clone by scanning repo with 'changemyname' [query](https://github.com/piotrkaczmarek/ng2AuthRouterStarter/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=change*my*name&type=Code) and replacing it with your project's name.


## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
